# 6 Interview Questions For Every Real Estate Agent

When meeting with a prospective Real Estate Agent for the first time, you are undoubtedly going to have a lot of questions. But the problem is, many questions are loaded, and buyers and sellers often have misconceptions regarding the answers they receive. However, there are pros and cons to many different scenarios. Below are the best questions to ask, and what you need to keep in mind when asking them.

### 1. How well do you know the market in the area *in this price range*?

##### What to know

Buyers and sellers will often ask an agent how well they know an area or what experience they have in an area. But what they often don't emphasize the price range. There are agents who may know an area well and do a lot of business in an area, but in a price range different than yours. This agent might not be as well suited for you as an agent who does less volume but in your price range because they may not price your home as accurately. And for buyers, they might not have the same connections to call upon when finding you a home.

### 2. How many clients are you currently working with?

##### What to know

Often times, a prospective buyer or seller will naturally want to go with a high volume agent. But it's important to know both the pros and cons of the answer. A high-volume agent might be able to sell your home quickly and might have more connections to help buyers - like former clients who may be interested in selling - a lower-volume agent might be able to put more time and effort into marketing your home and ensure that you get the best price for your home. Similarly, if you're a buyer, a lower-volume agent may put more time into showing you listings.

### 3. Do you have a team? If so, how are they involved and what are their qualifications?

##### What to know

It's not uncommon for high-volume agents to have a team helping them out. It's important to ask about their level of involvement because some buyers and sellers might not mind working mostly with the team, while other buyers and sellers might want to work exclusively with the agent. But a team can be highly beneficial because they aren't just working for the agent, they're also working for you. If you're selling an existing home and buying your next home, you might have one person putting all their time energy into marketing your current home, and another putting all their time and energy into finding and showing you prospective listings to move into. And when asking for their qualifications, keep in mind most assistants do not have their own real estate license, so don't be put off if the agent mentions this. They still might have a lot of experience and/or expertise in the role they will be playing. But don't necessarily be put off if an agent doesn't have a team. The real estate market is filled with ups and downs. And many agents don't hire assistants because it helps them stay in the business during down times (or they do simply prefer to not manage a team and still do well). So a solo agent still might be a good option.

### 4. How will you market my home and how will you help me find my next home?

##### What to know

The real estate industry is filled with various products and services for agents geared towards helping them sell homes quickly, as well as various products and services that help them access the MLS (Multiple Listing Service), which are much more versatile and robust than the home search sites that consumers use (and have more properties). Do they rely on more, "old-school" methods they find to be tried-and-true? Or do they go for the latest technology trend? This question will help you find out what products and services the agent will use - and ones you may have access to - that will help you on your home buying and selling journey.

### 5. How long have you been in real estate?

##### What to know

While the previous questions are formed to be specific, this one is intentionally more general. An agent may have only recently acquired their license, but maybe they worked for another agent for a couple years learning the ins-and-outs of the industry prior to becoming an agent themselves. And although many buyers and sellers are naturally inclined to want to go for a more experienced agent, keep in mind a newer agent might be more likely to embrace new technology solutions available to agents and might also be more likely to go the extra mile for their clients, since they are eager to get that first commission and make their mark on the industry. Furthermore, if a new agent is with a reputable brokerage, they often get a little added attention from administration within the brokerage, since the brokerage wants them to succeed as well.

### 6. What additional home service connections do you have and would be able to help me with?

##### What to know

This is not as common as other questions, but is important because it could save you a lot of stress (and money, too). Do you still need to sort out finding the right lender, contractor for renovations, or even a moving company? If an agent has been in the industry for a while, there's a good chance they have such connections they can help you with, which will save you a lot of time and stress searching on your own. And if you're lucky, you might even save money on some of them if the agent (or their brokerage) has given a lot of business and has a deal set up with one of the services. But keep in mind that you are legally allowed to use any lender you'd like. So if an agent does have a lender they exclusively work with, this just means that the agent won't recommend any other lender. But you can still hire the agent and use a different lender.
