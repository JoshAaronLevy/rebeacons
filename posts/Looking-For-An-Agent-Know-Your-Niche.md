# Looking For An Agent? Know Your Niche

One of the biggest mistakes buyers and sellers make when embarking on their search for a Real Estate Agent is they don't take time to identify their niche prior to searching for an agent. This is problematic because a general search online will often times just pull up agents who have invested the most time and money into search engine optimization on their website. Furthermore, searching for the, "best" agent in an area might bring up a high-volume agent or have been in the industry a long time, but might not be very experienced in working with clients with *your specific needs*. Below is a helpful guide with some examples to help ensure you identify your niche, and in turn, identify the agent who is best for you.

### Location and Home Type Niches

##### 1. Fix-And-Flip, Rental, etc.

When including this in your search, you're likely to find agents with some great renovation connections for a fix-and-flip, or provide you with great resources for when you want to rent a property after you close the deal. Furthermore, an experienced agent will know things like avoiding properties with high concessions if you're looking for a property to rent out, as this can be a red flag for high maintenance costs you'll accrue as a landlord down the road.

##### 2. Downtown Condo, Victorian Home, etc.

If you're looking for a chic downtown condo, an agent experienced in this niche will not only know that homeowners association fees can sometimes vary wildly between two different condos fairly close to one another, but will also be able to properly inform you on the difference in services provided by the HOA, and will bring this up early. Similarly, if you're looking for a Victorian Home, the right agent will know about possible issues, and more importantly, how to identify them before you fall in love with a home and receive the bad news from the home inspector.

##### 3. Green/Energy Efficient Homes

While many niches are either stagnant or highly cyclical, this is a niche that's sure to continue growing, as more and cheaper green products hit the market. The right agent will know everything from the quality of insulation in the walls to which homes have the most energy saving potential from solar panels you might install down the road.

### Buyer/Seller Type Niches

##### 1. Downsizing, Upsizing, etc.

If you're looking for a home to accomodate a new addition to the family, the right agent will put the right emphasis on discussing the school districts with you, not just focus solely on the house itself. But when it does come to the home, they will be able to easily identify features that relate to safety. And if you're an, "Empty-Nester," the agent will be able to identify your needs according to the major lifestyle adjustment.

##### 2. First-Time Homebuyer, New Couple Home, Pre-Foreclosure, Financial Distress etc.

These are very important niches, mainly because of the depth and breadth of the financial aspect within these niches. An agent who works frequently with first-time homebuyers will be well-informed on the various loan options available (and there are MANY), as well as be able to provide many helpful financial hints and tips. And if you are in a short-sale, pre-foreclosure or other situation relating to financial distress, the agent who is experienced in this area will not only be able to help you assess the various options you have (including ways you might be able to save your home), they will have the experience and resources to help you cope during the emotional distress of this experience.

##### 3. Military/Veteran, Relocation, Bilingual/Multi-Lingual etc.

This is an important niche to identify because anything related to demographics is a tricky issue. Due to certain laws and regulations, Real Estate Agents have to tread lightly when addressing a buyer or seller who makes a demographic-related request (although they can simply refer you to information on the U.S. Census Bureau's site, if they are asked a question about demographics that they aren't allowed to answer explicitly). So you can make this process a lot easier by identifying it as a niche, as you'll find an agent who will automatically narrow the search down to locations you'd be most comfortable in.
