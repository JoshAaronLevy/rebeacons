# 5 Reasons To NEVER Sell Your Home Yourself

Chances are, you've probably driven by a home with a sign stating, "For Sale By Owner" (FSBO) on more than one occasion. For some sellers, this may seem like an appealing option. But it's important to know the extent of the downsides to deciding to go the FSBO route. If you, or someone you know, is considering FSBO, here are four reasons to finally put those thoughts to rest.

### 1. You Won't Make As Much On The Sale

The #1 reason people decide to sell themselves is they believe they will end up making more money on the back-end because they won't be giving up a percentage of the sale price to an agent in commission. While you may not be giving up any amount in the form of commission, this doesn't mean you'll make more money. In fact, most of the time, it's the opposite. The right agent will be able to sell your house for the most amount of money. And although you'll have a slightly smaller portion of the pie, the pie itself will be bigger. 96% of a $450,000 sale is better than 100% of a $400,000 sale.

### 2. Lack Of Resources/Connections

If you are selling your home, one of the most important things to realize is that it's a numbers game. You want as many prospective buyers coming to your house as possible. And no matter how well-connected you might be or how much you promote your home on social media, nobody will be able to get more eyes on your home than an agent. They have access to products that are exclusively available to licensed Real Estate Agents. They also can pick up the phone and reach out to an extensive network, ranging from former clients who may be interested in your home, to any of the numerous agents they know to see if they have clients who would be interested. Furthermore, when someone does call to set up a showing, they will know how to get your home in perfect showing condition for the appointment.

### 3. Increased Potential Setbacks

Nothing quite takes the wind out of the sails of a seller like getting ready to pop the cork on the champagne bottle, only to find that the home inspector discovered a variety of issues and the deal has fallen out of escrow. You not only have to go back to square one with negotiating, but you're faced with a slew of options. Should you lower the price? Add a concession amount? Fix the issues and relist? While an agent might not be able to foresee all potential issues, they will certainly be more cognizant of them. And if you do encounter a situation where you have to decide on lowering the price, adding a concession amount or fixing the issues yourself, the agent will be able to help steer you in the right direction.

### 4. Red Flag For Buyers And Their Agents

When a buyer or their agent sees a property is a FSBO, this raises some red flags. Not only do they worry about the potential setbacks mentioned above, but also with the intricacies of working with another agent, vs working with the homeowner. Even if you have priced your home reasonably, done your research and are flexible, agents still prefer working with other agents. This is because they know all the ins-and-outs of the industry and the lingo, which makes it easier for them. Plus, negotiating isn't just what an agent does. It's in their blood. When it comes to the price negotiations, don't enter the ring by yourself. Send in a prized fighter instead.

### 5. More Stressful Than Ever Imagined

A LOT goes into the home selling process from start to finish, from marketing your home, to showings, listing presentations and open houses, price negotiations, finding your next home, assessing various financial and contract options with the deal (lending, title company, etc.), home inspections and more. There's a reason why licensed agents not only have to take courses and pass an exam, but also have to take Continuing Education courses throughout their entire career in order to keep their license. It's very complicated and it can be a lot to take in. And it can be increasingly stressful if you encounter a buyer's agent who hopes to capitalize on your lack of experience in the industry by presenting you with a low offer along with detailed reports to try convince you to bring that price down. A Real Estate Agent not only knows the process like the back of their hand and be extremely useful in helping you cope along the way, they also know how to handle even the toughest negotiating situations.
