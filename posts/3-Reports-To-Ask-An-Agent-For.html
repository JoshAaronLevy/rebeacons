<p>When meeting with a prospective Real Estate Agent for the first time, you are undoubtedly going to have a lot of questions. And a good agent is going to be able to provide a wide variety of reports. But it&#39;s hard to know which ones are the most helpful and how to understand the information you are being presented with. If you want to enter the market as a buyer and/or seller, here are three of the best reports you can ask your agent for and why they are helpful.</p>
<h3 id="1-comparative-market-analysis-cma-">1. Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)</h3>
<h5 id="what-it-is">What it is</h5>
<p>A CMA is the most accurate estimate of a home&#39;s value, next to a valuation given by an appraiser. Most online home estimates will simply average the sale price of homes sold in the area. But these valuations can be very inaccurate because they don&#39;t account for more specific adjustments. For instance, if the home has 4 bedrooms and most sold homes in the area have 3 bedrooms, the online estimate would be lower than the home&#39;s actual value.</p>
<h5 id="buyer-benefits">Buyer Benefits</h5>
<ol>
<li>Making sure you are not overpaying for a house. This may seem obvious, but overpaying not only affects you in the short term, but also has long term ramifications, since it affects the equity you are able to build over time.</li>
<li>Negotiating leverage. If a seller is priced too high, having a CMA to present along with your offer gives your offer more credibility. Plus, it helps prevent a seller from feeling like you are, &quot;low-balling&quot; them with your offer.</li>
<li>Avoid problems with getting the mortgage. This might seem like an odd benefit to list. But if you make an offer on a home that&#39;s too high without doing a CMA and the seller accepts your offer, the bank might not approve the loan if an appraiser deems the home is worth less than the amount you are trying to borrow. Although you could now possibly get the home for less, which sounds great, you are still having to go back to square one of negotiating with the seller after getting so close to moving into the home. And now the seller is likely to have a bad taste in their mouth after getting their hopes up, which doesn&#39;t exactly make for a smooth and easy negotiating process.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="seller-benefits">Seller Benefits</h5>
<ol>
<li>Price your home properly. The two situations no seller wants are listing their home at a price so high that it sits on the market for ages and they miss out on potential buyers, as well as a situation where they do sell their home, but could have sold it for more.</li>
<li>Know where you might be missing out on equity adding opportunities. Many sellers get upset when they hear their neighbor sold their home for $450,000 but an agent wants to list their home for $400,000. The CMA allows you to not only understand why the list prices are different, but also uncover opportunities to raise the value of your home. The CMA will show that the neighbor had maybe upgraded their kitchen and bathrooms, or finished their basement. This is why they were able to sell for $450,000. Furthermore, it helps you evaluate the true value of any renovations you might have in mind. If the bathroom renovations only added a little value to the home that sold, but the kitchen renovation added a significant value, you will be better off spending any renovation money you have on the kitchen before selling.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-list-sold-price-analysis">2. List/Sold Price Analysis</h3>
<h5 id="what-it-is">What it is</h5>
<p>This report is a list of properties that have sold in your area, but shows the price the homes were listed for, compared to the price they were sold for. When you ask for this report, make sure to ask for sold properties as far back as three years, if possible. NOTE: Ask to see the orignal list price and current list price. Original list price is what a property was listed for when it first went on the market. Current list price shows what the property was listed for when it sold.</p>
<h5 id="buyer-benefits">Buyer Benefits</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make the right offer. If most properties are selling for at least 97% of their asking price, then you may want to rethink your offer of 90% of the asking price of a property you like. The seller will most likely reject it, if not become offended by it, which hurts your chances of getting the home in the end. Same goes the other way around. If you were planning on offering 97% of the asking price, but most properties are selling at around 90%, you might be able to make an offer closer to the 90%.</li>
<li>Market indicator. The reason you should ask for properties dating back three years is because this is a good market indicator of the area. If properties sold three years ago averaged 97% of the list price and properties sold within the last six months had the same average, this can indicate that the area you are looking at is fairly stable in a highly cyclical industry filled with ups and downs.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="seller-benefits">Seller Benefits</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get the right offer. Much like #1 on the buyer list, you want to make sure you get the best price for your home. If most homes in the area are selling at 97% of the asking price, and a buyer offers you 90%, it&#39;s not a bad idea to make a counter-offer. Furthermore, if most homes have sold for 92% of their list price and someone does make you an offer at 90%, making a counter-offer at 97% may be a bit too high.</li>
<li>Look at the original list price compared to the current list price before the properties were sold. If most sellers had to make list price reductions before selling their home, don&#39;t be surprised or offended if your agent comes to you and makes the same suggestion. They want you to get the best price for your home, too. But they also know if a home stays on the market too long because it&#39;s priced too high, buyers are going to try use this to their advantage by highlighting it when they make their offer. It shifts negotiating leverage and only makes it harder to sell your home.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3-days-on-market-analysis">3. Days On Market Analysis</h3>
<h5 id="what-it-is">What it is</h5>
<p>This report is a list of properties that have sold in your area, but shows how long the properties were on the market before they sold. When you ask for this report, make sure to ask for sold properties as far back as three years. NOTE: Ask for total days on market and current days on market. Sometimes an MLS (Multiple Listing Service) will reset the counter for certain changes. For instance, if a property goes under contract, but the deal falls through and the property goes back on the market, the current days on market will show how long it has been on the market since it was relisted, but total days on market will date back to when it was originally listed.</p>
<h5 id="buyer-benefits">Buyer Benefits</h5>
<ol>
<li>Know how fast the market is moving. If you find a home you love in an area where homes only stay on the market for a few days, the market is hot and it&#39;s moving fast. Every Real Estate Agent has stories of a buyer who wanted to think it over for a while and missed an opportunity. If the market is hot, make sure you are prepared to make an offer quickly if there&#39;s a home you like.</li>
<li>Make the best offer. If a home has only recently hit the market, and especially if the market is hot, your offer will most likely have to be pretty close to the asking price for the seller to entertain it. This is critical because if you offend a seller with your offer, you&#39;ve lost a lot of leverage, no matter how hot or cold the market may be.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="seller-benefits">Seller Benefits</h5>
<ol>
<li>To sell or not to sell? If you are just considering putting your house on the market and aren&#39;t in a position where you need to sell, this is possibly the #1 report you should look at. If homes are selling within a week of going on the market, then it&#39;s a seller&#39;s market and may be the time to list your home.</li>
<li>Know who has the most leverage. If the market is hot and you receive an offer within the first couple days of listing your home, you might be able to wait a bit before accepting the offer because others might come in. You can possibly find yourself conducting a bidding war between buyers, and possibly even get more than you asked for. However, if the market has cooled down and homes are staying on the market for months, you might want to seriously consider taking that early offer, since another one may not be right around the corner. But as always, discuss this with your agent before making your decision. If you have the right Real Estate Agent, they will steer you in the right direction.</li>
</ol>
